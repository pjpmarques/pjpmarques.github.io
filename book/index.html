<h4 id="from-bangladesh-with-love">From Bangladesh with love</h4>
<p>It&apos;s a hot Tuesday afternoon when Chandni Akhand receives a call. Chandni works at a major bank in Bangladesh and everything looked fine until the phone rang. A representative from DBBT Bank, out of Philippines, is inquiring about a $2.3 million dollar wire transaction. The beneficiary&apos;s name doesn&apos;t match. Worse than that, entering the transaction id in the core banking system shows no record of the transaction ever taking place. A hot flash goes through Chandni&apos;s face as she realizes something is seriously wrong. Things are only to get worse as by the end of the week the reconciliation system shows that over $800M has been transferred without a single record existing.</p>
<h4 id="japans-lovely-country-side">Japan&apos;s lovely country side</h4>
<p>Hayato Suzuki was felling nervous. He walked down Shinsaibashi-suji, one of Osaka&apos;s main shopping areas, with a batch of credit cards in his pocket. Needless to say, none was legit. Trying not to look too conspicuous, he withdraws 100,000 yen from the corner ATM; his 12th withdraw of the day. Over the next couple of hours Hayato and his friends successful steal over 1.4 billion yen ($12.7M) in one of the largest coordinated on-foot heists in history. Over 14,000 withdraws take place across 16 prefectures using credit cards. The source: a major data leak at a South African bank.</p>
<h4 id="out-on-the-street-again">Out on the street again</h4>
<p>The web site was being bombarded again. Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t a denial of service attack. It was much worse than that. Hundreds of bots were trying to buy perfume from the store using thousands of different IPs. While they weren&apos;t overwhelming the side, it was virtually impossible to distinguish legitimate customers from those automated buying machines. John Cash was in charge of cybersecurity and his job was at risk. Expensive perfume sells extremely well on the black market. How could criminals have become so sophisticated? When did his job really become so much at risk? Before the day ended his company would be out of $100,000 worth of stock. Not to mention all the chargebacks that were coming down the line due to the use of stolen credit cards on the web site.</p>
<h3 id="about-this-book">About this book</h3>
<p>This book is about using Machine Learning to fight fraud. Machine Learning --<em>the ability to have computers automatically learn and detect patterns</em>-- is one of the most exciting advances in computer science of the last 10 years. Only now with the exponential increase in computational power, wide availability of data, and advances in distributed processing, it&apos;s truly possible to leverage machine learning to its true potential.</p>
<p>For the past years we have been at the front lines of preventing fraud. Our moto: &quot;Make Commerce Safe.&quot; In this book we intend to share some of the stories but, more importantly, contribute to the fight against fraud. Machine Learning gives you super powers. Use them for good.</p>
